Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the termination of impulse transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. It catalyzes the rapid hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter, into choline and acetate, thereby breaking down the signal and preventing prolonged activation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.

AChE is primarily found at postsynaptic neuromuscular junctions, especially in muscles and nerves, and is essential for proper muscle function. Its activity is higher in motor neurons than in sensory neurons. Additionally, AChE is also present in the red blood cell membranes, where it constitutes the Yt blood group antigen.

I choose to analyze this enzyme and its relatives proteins and compounds with the objective of finding possible drugs. All along this repository you'll find how this is carried, how can we detect candidates for drugs and each important result obtained.
